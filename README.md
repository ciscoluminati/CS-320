How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

To do that you should run your program as you write it. And test your code as you write it. Dynamic testing is a very useful technique and I believe it is the most efficient way to do so.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

I put a lot of focus on the used case that were mentioned in the resources document and try to design my system around the requirement that was related to the user needs. Because the requirements are basically the guideline of the program analysis. They are vital to the making of the program. even concerning the security part of the program. All those elements are being figured out in the requirement gathering. Without the requirement or without considering user needs crafting an application is impossible because you donâ€™t know what you are doing.

How do I approach designing software?

Get as many requirement gathering as possible.
